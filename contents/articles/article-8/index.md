Small farmers are mixing old equipment with new tech
</h3>
<br>
<p>Before Leo Sanchez will talk about his farm, he has to ask: “Do you like the website?” The owner of Lazy Millennial Farms designed it himself. It took a Squarespace subscription and two months of intermittent work to get things up and running.</p>
<span class="more"></span>
<p>Satisfied with my response, Sanchez is ready to get down to business. The 26-year-old farmer launches into an animated description of the density of his lettuce beds; the value of veganics, a nascent method of cultivating plants without animal-based fertilizers; and the ceaseless, indefatigable weeds, which will happily crowd out Sanchez’s crops if he doesn’t kill them first.</p>

<p>Besides the name, there’s a lot about Sanchez and his Salinas, California farm that seems unusual. At about an acre, it’s small—smaller than some people's backyards. The <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/farms-in-us-drops-size-grows">national average farm size is around 440 acres</a>. At 26, Sanchez is a young proprietor. Since the 1980s, the <a href="https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Highlights/Farm_Demographics/">average age of farmers has risen</a> in every USDA Agricultural Census. Currently, it hovers <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/02/24/us-farmers-are-old-and-getting-much-older">around 58 years old</a>. And Sanchez’s constant tinkering with everything from seeding techniques out in the field to the promotion and sale of his produce online is evidence of an experimental approach, not dictated by the confines of conventional, large-scale agriculture.</p>

<p>While farming is often difficult for both the body and mind, Sanchez says he and many of his fellow young farmers (roughly defined as farmers under 35) are motivated by a desire to set a new standard for agriculture. Many of them are starting small with the hope of refining their climate-conscious practices and slowly working to scale them over time. To do this, young farmers are employing a bevy of technologies, some new and some… not so new.</p>
